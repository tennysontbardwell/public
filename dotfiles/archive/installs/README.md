# Installs

`all-install.sh` should be run on any mac or linux fresh install first

`arch-install.sh` is the most up to date in terms of the packages I use

`mac-install.sh` is not up to date but helpful

`dockerfile` is used to test the `arch-install.sh` script

`scripts` holds useful scripts for my config files

`config_gen_all.sh` should be run on any changes, as well as `sudo config_gen_all.sh root`
